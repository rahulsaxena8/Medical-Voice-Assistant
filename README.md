# Medical-Voice-Assistant

In this project I have created a voice app for doctors which acts as replacing a human clinic assistant. We are assuming that for for booking appointment patients will
go to the clinic website where they will fill a google form. They will fill name, appointment date, time, reason and medical history. All this information will be 
automatically sent to a google sheet. In my current project doctor can make three requests to assistant- 

(1) How many appointments left for the day?

(2) Give details of next appointment.

(3) Start the next appointment.

A display will be present outside doctor's room which will display a message requesting patient to come inside. When the appointment is over it will display thanks 
for visiting. Telegram app will be open in display. Doctor do not need to write precription on paper. He/she can simply dictate it and it will be noted on evernote app. 
Doctor can simply whatsapp or mail it to patient. Doctor can close the app by saying close or no or nothing. Afetr the appointment is complete with a patient the 'Next
Appointment' column corresponding to the patient which was 'Yes' earlier will become 'No'.

Whole flow of the app was made on Voiceflow application. Anyone can make voice apps on it and upload it on google actions console. Google assistant is able to communicate
with telegram,evernote and google sheets via integromat platform.
